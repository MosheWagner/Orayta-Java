# Orayta-Java

Orayta is a open-source, cross platform port to the "תורת אמת" project.
( http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/ ) - http://orayta.googlecode.com/

The project intends to allow free and simple access to Jewish sources, from the Bible, Mishna and Talmud, to books written in the last years.


This specific repository is for a brand new full re-write of Orayta in JAVA!

This project was mainly written by Moshe Wagner (moshe.wagner@gmail.com), and is licensed under GPLv2.

The books are the basically the same ones used in the original ToratEmet project (plus a few we added) - And are licensed (mainly) under the CC license.

Bug reports, ideas, and comments are greatly welcome at -
